# I would like to build an application that builds new MCP servers upon request with a user prompt or from reference provided by user (e.g. URL, PDF, TXT, etc.); allow for user to specify sources to be monitored for updates to MCP server lists (e.g. MCP servers and Awesome MCP servers GitHub repos); and maintains a database, preferably some variation of RAG with reranking, of a MCP server library either locally or in the cloud. I have added a 'MyMCP' folder to the 'MCP-repos' folder which contains many repos to be integrated into the library.

### UI Note: 

## The following task should be built into the application to fulfill that goal (not exhaustive, so please suggest modifications or additions):
- Name of application = MyMCP
- Version Management = Git & GitHub
- Back End = Python
- Environment & Dependency Management = UV
- Database = local: PostgreSQL or cloud: MongoDB
- Front End/UI = no preference* (see note)
- Location of MyMCP (folder & uv managed venv created) = C:\Users\AlexJ\Documents\Coding\Repos\MCP-repos\mymcp
- Location of all MCP repos = C:\Users\AlexJ\Documents\Coding\Repos\MCP-repos
- Directory Tree for MCP-repos and all subfolders: C:\Users\AlexJ\Documents\Coding\Repos\MCP-repos\MCP-repos-directory-tree-20241227.txt
